## Description

This web application allows two players to play a game of Pig Dice.

## Specification

Pig Dice Final will prompt the user to enter two player names, the number of dice to play with and what nummber of points players want to play until. From there it is a game of pig dice! Roll the die or dice and make a decision to continue rolling or bank the points you have accumulated by holding. Be particularlly careful though, rolling a 1 will end your turn and you will recieve no points for that turn. Achieve the total number of points set at the beginning of the game and become a champion.
